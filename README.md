This analysis provides a detailed look at the performance of schools provided in the PyCity file, it focuses on budget allocation, student achievement in math and reading, and overall pass rates. There are two CSV files, containing school and student information which I combined and analyzed to create this report. Key metrics in this report that were calculated were the total number of schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and pass rates in math, reading, and in math & reading subjects combined. This enabled an analysis into the district as well as the individual schools.

Key Findings

District Summary:
Total Schools: 15
Total Students: 39,170
Total Budget: $24,649,428
Average Math Score: 78.98
Average Reading Score: 81.88
% Passing Math: 74.98%
% Passing Reading: 85.81%
% Overall Passing: 65.17%

School Summary:
I calculated performance metrics for each school, including total students, school budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, and pass rates for math, reading, and overall subjects.

Highest & Lowest Performing Schools:
I identified the top 5 schools based on overall pass rates.
I also identified the bottom 5 schools based on overall pass rates.

Math and Reading Scores by Grade:
I calculated average scores for math and reading across different grades (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) for each school.


Scores by School Spending:
Schools were categorized into spending ranges per student, and performance metrics were calculated for each spending range.

Scores by School Size:
Schools were categorized into size ranges based on total students, and performance metrics were calculated for each size range.

Scores by School Type:
I calculated performance metrics for different school types (Charter, District).

Conclusion:

Two conclusions from the calculations:

1. Class Size Impact on Performance:
The analysis showed that smaller schools tend to have better student performance. Schools with fewer than 1,000 students had higher average math and reading scores compared to larger schools. For example, small schools had an average math score of ~83%, while large schools with more than 2,000 students had an average of ~76%. This allows us to make a conclusion that smaller class sizes allow for a more personalized learning environment which can possibly contribute to better academic outcomes.
2. Overall Student Performance:
Students did a lot better in individual subjects rather than in both subject together. Individual pass rates in math were ~75% and in reading ~85%. The overall pass rate in Math & Reading was only ~65%. This indicates that a strong number of students struggle with excelling in both subjects simultaneously, which brings into focus the need for integrated programs to help students excel in both areas.
